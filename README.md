# Telegram

### Where to begin?

Just jump into my straightforward guide: [How to send Telegram messages from a script](How_to_send_Telegram_messages_from_a_script.md)

### What's next?

Besides just sending messages, you can also create a program that 'listens' for messages in the chat. This allows the program to interact with a user who sends it commands through Telegram.

I'll be publishing a project soon called 'telegramSteward' that uses this idea.
